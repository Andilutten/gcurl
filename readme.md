# Golang Curl
I hate using curl. Mainly because of the interface. I can never remember wich flags does what, so i created a tiny curlish client in golang to help me achieve the same purpose

## Installation
Get the code and install the binary, and you are done
```bash
go get -u github.com/Andilutten/gcurl
go install github.com/Andilutten/gcurl
```

## Usage
I will update this section when i feel the need to it :) 
To list options:
```bash
gcurl --help
```
